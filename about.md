## About the game and name

This is a patience (or solitaire) game, 
where a deck of cards is shuffled and dealt into four rows of thirteen cards.
The Aces are then removed, leaving spaces. 
The aim is to sort each row into ascending order, from 2 to King, ending with a space, one row per suit, 
by moving cards into spaces, one at a time, according to the rules. 
See the [Instructions](#Instructions) page for full details on how to play.

I learnt this patience from my grandparents when I was young. 
In my family, we know it as "interference", 
because whenever anybody sits down to play, 
someone else comes and stands over their shoulder and interferes by suggesting what the next move should be.

I couldn't find any information about a patience called "interference"
and finally discovered (as I was writing this page) that it is actually known as [Gaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaps). 
That said, to me (and in honour of my grandpartents) it's still "interference", 
I'm sticking with that as the name of the game as I've built it here.

## About the development history

I first learnt to code back in 2013 by taking an "Introduction to Programming" online course which taught Python by building simple games.
After the course, I wanted to challenge myself and so I made v1 of Interference, using the CodeSkultpur platform and the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/simplegui/" target="_blank">simplegui</a> package (as we'd used in the course). It's still available to play [here](https://py2.codeskulptor.org/#user51_AaJ8ZQvnxh3PPb7.py). The game is far more complex than anything we built during the course. It took me weeks to figure out the logic and the corresponding code and, at the time, I was really proud of it. Looking back on it now, it's definitely newbie code (no class inheritance, so many global variables!) The appearance also looks dated, simplegui is no longer developed, it's in Python 2, and the instructions have disappeared.

Several times over the last decade, as I've improved as a developer, I've thought about reworking the game as a way to learn new technologies. In particular, I considered Python 3, R Shiny or Observable JS, but it was never a priority.

This year (2024), I worked through weeks 1-5 of [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/), Harvard's excellent Introduction to Computer Science course, as part of the [C Study Group for R Contributors](https://contributor.r-project.org/events/c-study-group-2024/). I enjoyed it so much that I decided to complete the course. So, I needed a [final project](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/project/). I finally had a good reason to return to Interference.
