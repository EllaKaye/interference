## About the game and name

This is a patience (or solitaire) game, 
where a deck of cards is shuffled and dealt into four rows of thirteen cards.
The Aces are then removed, leaving spaces. 
The aim is to sort each row into ascending order, from 2 to King, ending with a space, one row per suit, 
by moving cards into spaces, one at a time, according to the rules. 
See the [Instructions](#Instructions) page for full details on how to play.

I learnt this patience from my grandparents when I was young. 
In my family, it's called "interference", 
because whenever anybody sits down to play, 
someone else comes and stands over their shoulder and interfere by suggesting what the next move should be.

I couldn't find any information about a patience called "interference"
and finally found out (as I was writing this page) that it is actually called [Gaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaps). 
That said, to me (and in honour of my grandpartents) it's still "interference", 
so that's what I'm sticking with as the name of the game as I've built it here.

After the course, I wanted to challenge myself by ...
