## About the game and name

This is a patience (or solitaire) game, 
where a deck of cards is shuffled and dealt into four rows of thirteen cards.
The Aces are then removed, leaving spaces. 
The aim is to sort each row into ascending order, from 2 to King, ending with a space, one row per suit, 
by moving cards into spaces, one at a time, according to the rules. 
See the [Instructions](#Instructions) page for full details on how to play.

I learnt this patience from my grandparents when I was young. 
In my family, we know it as "interference", 
because whenever anybody sits down to play, 
someone else comes and stands over their shoulder and interferes by suggesting what the next move should be.

I couldn't find any information about a patience called "interference"
and finally discovered (as I was writing this page) that it is actually known as [Gaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaps). 
That said, to me (and in honour of my grandpartents) it's still "interference" and
I'm sticking with that as the name of the game as I've built it here.

## About the development history

I first learnt to code back in 2013 by taking an "Introduction to Programming" online course which taught Python by building simple games.
After the course, I wanted to challenge myself and so I made v1 of Interference, using the CodeSkultpur platform and the simple package (as we'd used in the course). It's still available to <a href="https://py2.codeskulptor.org/#user51_AaJ8ZQvnxh3PPb7.py" target="_blank">play</a>. The game is far more complex than anything we built during the course. It took me weeks to figure out the logic and the corresponding code and, at the time, I was really proud of it. Looking back on it now, it's definitely newbie code (limited understanding of classes, so many global variables!) The appearance also looks dated, simplegui is no longer developed, it's in Python 2, and the instructions have disappeared.

Several times over the last decade, as I've improved as a developer, I've thought about reworking the game as a way to learn new technologies. In particular, I considered Python 3, R Shiny or Observable JS, but it was never a priority.

This year (2024), I worked through weeks 1-5 of [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/), Harvard's excellent Introduction to Computer Science course, as part of the [C Study Group for R Contributors](https://contributor.r-project.org/events/c-study-group-2024/). I enjoyed it so much that I decided to complete the course. So, I needed a [final project](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/project/). I finally had a good reason to return to Interference.

After much deliberation, I opted to use the <a href="https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/" target="_blank">Python Arcade</a> library as the games engine. Their <a href="https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/tutorials/card_game/index.html" target="_blank">Solitaire tutorial</a> was a great place to start. I rewrote Interference from scratch, though obviously v1 was a useful reference. 

The Python Arcade <a href="https://github.com/ellakaye/interference-arcade" target="_blank">implementation</a> would have been v2, and I got almost all the way there with it.
The game is playable (though missing the logic that indicates when it is over), and there are no instructions either for the rules, or how to start a new round or game. 
Although pretty much done, I wasn't loving the library. 
I found drag and drop to be buggy, so implemented it just with clicks, but even that froze sometimes. I didn't love how it looked, nor that you couldn't resize the window, and that it was only playable on a computer. 

Then I saw a post on Mastodon abut the <a href="https://posit.co/blog/announcing-the-2024-shiny-contest/" target="_blank">Shiny Contest</a>, 
with a submission deadline about three weeks away,
and decided to abandon work on v2 and start work on v3, using <a href="https://shiny.posit.co/py/" target="_blank">Shiny for Python</a>. Also games aren't Shiny's raison d'Ãªtre, I'd seen this <a href="https://github.com/dreamRs/memory-hex" target="_blank">hex sticker memory game</a> a few years ago, so figured it should be possible.

With the help of <a href="https://gallery.shinyapps.io/assistant/" target="_blank">Shiny Assistant</a> (more on my use of LLMs in the section below), 
I had translated the Arcade implementation into Shiny app in surprisingly little time,
and was very pleased I'd made the shift, because the latter looks and feels so much better.

From there, I've spent a couple of weeks making improvements. 
The more I've learnt about what Shiny for Python is capable of,
especially in combination with CSS and JavaScript, the more I've wanted to do!
Thankfully, the documentation is very good.
In particular, I'm pleased with the use of modals for round over and game over messages,
how the app is now styled, and the implemation of drag and drop, 
which was a substantial refactoring of the click-based approach.

There are still elements of the UI and the underlying code that I'm conscious could be improved.
In particular, the whole card grid is rendered on every drag event, and every card swap.
In retrospect, it would have been better to go with a design that laid out each card individually, 
and only re-rendered the one or two cards that moved in each go.
I did attempt a refactor along these lines, using a module for the cards, 
but haven't yet been able to get it to work.
