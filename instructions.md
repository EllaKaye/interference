## Aim of the game
Arrange each row in ascending order, from 2 to King (followed by a playing space), one row per suit.

## How to Play

- At the start, the deck is shuffled and dealt into four rows of 13 cards, then the Aces are removed to create playing spaces.

- Drag and drop cards into playing spaces to move them, according to the following rules:

    - If there's a playing space at the beginning of the row, any 2 can go there.

    - Otherwise, you can only put a card in a space if it's the next card in sequence and of the same suit as the card on the left of the space, e.g. only the 3♠️ can go after the 2♠️, only the J♥️ can go after 10♥️.

    - Nothing can go after an King, or after a playing space.

- The layout is stuck if there are no valid moves left, i.e. if all playing spaces are after Kings or other playing spaces.

- When the layout is stuck, to start a new round, click the 'New Round' button. This will collect and shuffle all the cards that are not yet in order, then deal them out again to fill the rows, leaving one playing space in each row, after the ordered cards.

- A game consists of up to three rounds.

- Because there are up to four valid moves at any time, this is a version of solitaire that requires some skill (as well as the luck of the deal). You have a better chance of success if you think strategically. What card would you like to be able to move? What other cards need to move to make that possible?

- The game ends when all rows are correctly ordered or when the third round is stuck.

- Start a new game by clicking the 'New Game' button.
